SELF-RECHARGING SOLAR TRIBRID VEHICLE WITH  INTEGRATED IOT, PETROL AND LPG SYSTEMS
Hybrid vehicles represent a groundbreaking shift in automotive technology, combining the strengths of electric motors and traditional internal combustion engines to provide a more  efficient and eco-friendly alternative to conventional vehicles. By utilizing both power sources, hybrid vehicles are able to optimize fuel consumption, reduce harmful emissions, and provide greater flexibility and performance in diverse driving conditions. These vehicles represent a crucial step forward in the ongoing effort to reduce the environmental impact of transportation, offering a cleaner and more sustainable mobility solution.

The importance of sustainable energy solutions in the modern world is critical as the negative impacts of fossil fuel consumption on the environment become increasingly evident. With transportation contributing significantly to global carbon emissions, adopting greener alternatives is essential in mitigating climate change. The shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, such as solar and electric power, has become a focal point for innovation in the transportation sector. By transitioning to cleaner energy, we can reduce the reliance on non-renewable resources, decrease pollution, and pave the way for a more sustainable future.

The integration of solar power into vehicles is one of the most promising solutions for addressing energy consumption and environmental concerns. Solar panels can capture energy from the sun and convert it into electricity to power the vehicle’s electric motor or recharge the battery. This system allows the vehicle to run more efficiently by utilizing a free and renewable energy source, especially in sunny regions, reducing the need for frequent recharging from the grid. Furthermore, integrating solar power into hybrid vehicles enhances their energy autonomy, allowing them to operate with minimal reliance on external charging infrastructure.
 
This project aims to design and develop a Solar Power Car with Hybrid Petrol, LPG, and Electric Systems, enhanced by a self-recharge system through an alternator. The vehicle will intelligently switch between power modes electric, LPG, and petrol based on speed and driving conditions, ensuring optimal fuel efficiency. The self-recharge feature will enable the battery to be replenished during vehicle operation, reducing the need for external charging stations. Additionally, a Raspberry Pi-based control system will manage energy switching, monitor system performance, and enable live tracking via IoT technology. This project seeks to offer an advanced, sustainable, and adaptable solution to future transportation challenges while demonstrating the potential of solar energy in hybrid vehicle applications.

Through this innovative approach, the project not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also sets a foundation for future developments in smart, solar-powered hybrid vehicles. The use of alternative energy sources, self-recharge capabilities, and intelligent control systems demonstrates the potential of combining cutting-edge technology with sustainable practices to revolutionize the way we think about transportation.
